# Welcome to the Water Module!

The first TOPSTSCHOOL Module on Water consists of three vignettes which
cover examples of water use, safety, and anomalies such as droughts and
floods. The vignettes use three datasets to walk users through lessons
in accessing and analyzing data, and users will be able to adapt the
code in all three examples to perform analyses including data cleaning,
processing to subset to an area of interest, and creating visualizations
to share what they have learned with their communities. Users will
understand an Open Science workflow including accessing and citing open
data. The three datasets and vignettes cover:

- **WSIM-GLDAS:** Exploring water anomalies using a historical dataset.
  - [Lesson 1a: Acquiring and Pre-Processing
    WSIM-GLDAS](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-water/m101-wsim-gldas.html)
- **MODIS Near Real Time flood data:** Lessons in data acquisition and
  analysis of recent water anomalies.
  - [Lesson 2: Acquiring and Exploring MODIS NRT Flood
    Data](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-water/m102-lance-modis-nrt-global-flood.html)
- **Lead in New York State Schools:** Exploring lead contamination data
  and US Census data and lessons in data cleaning and visualization,
  with a discerning eye toward data limitations.
  - [Lesson 3: NYC School Water Quality: Exposure to Lead Data](https://topstschool.shinyapps.io/nyc-lead/)

This course was made possible thanks to the work of our NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) team, our SCHOOL Open Science team, open science Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and the SCHOOL Development team!
