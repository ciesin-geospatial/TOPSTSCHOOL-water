Welcome to the first module of the TOPSTSCHOOL curriculum!

The Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) is part of the [NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS)](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) Training (TOPST) initiative, designed to generate an inclusive culture of open science. You can learn more about the SCHOOL Project and other modules on the [SCHOOL Project home page.](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL/)

The first SCHOOL Module: Water explores how humans impact the water cycle and are affected by the changes they cause. The module consists of three use cases that cover examples of water use, safety, and anomalies such as droughts and floods. Each use case uses a unique dataset to walk users through lessons in accessing and analyzing data, and further adapting the code to perform their analyses including data cleaning, processing to subset to an area of interest, and creating visualizations to share what they have learned with their communities.

**This module is tailored to instruct undergraduate students and early-career researchers with some coding language exposure about the data science life cycle, illustrating how Open Science principles can be effectively applied to earth sciences, particularly in the context of water.**

The SCHOOL Modules do not intend to teach all-encompassing earth science lessons nor provide learners with total coding expertise. Instead, the SCHOOL Project aims to provide users with the skills to adapt the SCHOOL lessons to the users’ own Open Science workflow. To learn more about Open Science, explore [NASA's TOPS Open Science 101 Curriculum](https://openscience101.org/).

The Module 1: Water datasets and use cases cover:

-   **Water Security Indicator Model - Global Land Data Assimilation System (WSIM-GLDAS):** Exploring water anomalies using a historical dataset.
    -   [Lesson 1: Acquiring and Pre-Processing WSIM-GLDAS](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-module-1-water/wsim-gldas-acquisition.html)
    -   [Lesson 2: Advanced Visualizations with WSIM-GLDAS](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-module-1-water/wsim-gldas-vis.html)
-   **Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Near-Real Time (NRT) flood data:** Lessons in data acquisition and analysis of recent water anomalies.
    -   [Lesson 3: Acquiring and Exploring MODIS NRT Flood Data](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-module-1-water/lance-modis-nrt-global-flood-mcdwd-f3.html)
