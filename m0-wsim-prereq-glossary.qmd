## Glossary

**Aerosols :** are small particles suspended in the atmosphere. They are often not or barely visible to the human eye, yet their impact on climate, weather, health, and ecology are significant. ([Chen et al., 2015](https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/climate/data/deep-blue/aerosols#:~:text=Sea%20spray%2C%20mineral%20dust%2C%20smoke,from%20volcanoes%20or%20industrial%20emissions))

**Aggregate :** the formation or combination of units or items ([Great Schools Partnership, 2013](https://www.edglossary.org/aggregate-data/))

**Application Programming Interface (API) :** is a set of defined rules that explain how computers or applications communicate with one another. APIs sit between an application and the web server and act as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems. ([Earth Science Data Systems API, 2015](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/technology/application-programming-interface-api))

**Atmosphere :** Earth’s atmosphere is a thin veil of gas surrounding the planet. Although it only extends a few hundred kilometers above the surface, it contains a mixture of gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen, that are critical for life to exist. It distributes incoming solar radiation, protecting life from harmful ultraviolet radiation but also driving atmospheric circulation and weather. ([Earth Science Data Systems, 2015](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/atmosphere)), ([Education, 2021](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/what-is-atmosphere))

**Atmospheric Circulation :** is the movement of air around the planet. It explains how thermal energy and storm systems move over the Earth's surface. ([U.S. Department of Commerce, 2023](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/global/global-atmospheric-circulations#:~:text=Global%20Atmospheric%20Circulation%20is%20the,global%20circulation%20would%20be%20simple), [University of California Museum of Paleontology, 2022](https://ugc.berkeley.edu/background-content/atmospheric-circulation/#heading1))

**Contaminant :** a contaminant is any physical, chemical, biological or radiological substance or matter that affects the composition, taste, or safety in water. ([Environmental Protection Agency, CCL 2024](https://www.epa.gov/ccl/definition-contaminant))

**Drought :** is an extended period of unusually dry weather when there is not enough rain. ([Rodgers, 2024](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/understanding-droughts/)), ([NCEI, 2024](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/dyk/drought-definition))

**Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) :** is the core operational system that provides end-to-end capabilities for managing NASA Earth science data from various sources—satellites, aircraft, field measurements, and various other programs. ([Earth Science Data Systems EOSDIS, 2019)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis), [(NASA Earth Science Data Systems Program highlights, 2020](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/esds-highlights/nasa-earth-science-data-systems-program-highlights-2019))

**Evaporation :** is the process that changes liquid water to gaseous water (water vapor). Water moves from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere via evaporation. ([Water Science School, 2019](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/evaporation-and-water-cycle))

**Hectare :** is 10,000 square meters (10,000 m2).

**Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) :** LANCE is a component of the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). LANCE products are used for monitoring fires, dust storms, hurricanes, air quality, sea ice, vegetation and crop development and volcanic eruptions. ([NASA Earth Science Data Systems LANCE, 2015](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/lance))

**Lead :** Lead is a naturally occurring metal that can be found throughout the earth, particularly in the Earth's crust. It can toxic to humans and animals and lead to health effects. ([Environmental Protection Agency, Learn about Lead 2024](https://www.epa.gov/lead/learn-about-lead))

**Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) :** is an instrument that collects remotely sensed data used by scientists for monitoring, modeling, and assessing the effects of natural processes and human actions on the Earth’s surface. ([USGS, LP DAAC, 2008](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3061/pdf/fs2008-3061.pdf) , [(Frazier & Maccherone, 2000)](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/))

**Near Real-Time (NRT) :** data are made available more rapidly than routine processing allows, generally with 1-3 hours after a satellite observation. ([NASA Earth Science Systems, NRT 2015](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/near-real-time-versus-standard-products))

**Outlier :** a data point that differs significantly from other observations in the dataset. ([NIST, 2012](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section1/prc16.htm))

**Precipitation :** is any liquid or frozen water that forms in the atmosphere and falls to Earth. It is one of the three main steps of the global water cycle. ([National Geographic Society, Precipitation 2023](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/precipitation/))

**Raster (Dataset) :** a raster consists of a matrix of cells (or pixels) organized into rows and columns (or a grid) where each cell contains a value representing information, such as temperature. ([ArcMap, What is raster data?](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/what-is-raster-data.htm#GUID-CBED6408-2437-4554-A3E1-F0FDC4AFBD63))

**Spatial Data :** refers to geographic information about the earth's features and boundaries that identifies a location or area. ([The University of Manchester, Spatial Data: Methods\@manchester: The University of Manchester](https://www.methods.manchester.ac.uk/themes/spatial-and-gis-methods/spatial-data/))

**US Census Bureau :** produces data about the American people including the country's population size and growth as well as changing characteristics of communities and the economy. ([Bureau, About the Bureau 2023](https://www.census.gov/en.html))

**Web Coverage Service (WCS) :** offers multi-dimensional coverage data for access over the Internet. WCS Core specifies a core set of requirements that a WCS implementation must fulfill. ([Open Geospatial Consortium, Web coverage service 2023](https://www.ogc.org/standard/wcs/#:~:text=A%20Web%20Coverage%20Service%20WCS,a%20WCS%20implementation%20must%20fulfill))

**Web Map Service :** The OpenGIS® Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS) provides a simple HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed geospatial databases. ([Open Geospatial Consortium, 2023](https://www.ogc.org/standard/wms/))
